.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The io_uring_prep_accept() function prepares an accept request. The submission
queue entry
.I sqe
is setup to use the file descriptor
.I sockfd
to start accepting a connection request described by the socket address at
.I addr
and of structure length
.I addrlen
and using modifier flags in
.I flags.

For a direct descriptor accept request, the offset is specified by the
.I file_index
argument. Direct descriptors are io_uring private file descriptors. They
avoid some of the overhead associated with thread shared file tables, and
can be used in any io_uring request that takes a file descriptor. To do so,
.B IOSQE_FIXED_FILE
must be set in the SQE
.I flags
member, and the SQE
.I fd
field should use the direct descriptor value rather than the regular file
descriptor. Direct descriptors are managed like registered files.

If the direct variant is used, the application must first have registered
a file table using
.BR io_uring_register_files (3)
of the appropriate size. Once registered, a direct accept request may use any
entry in that table, as long as it is within the size of the registered table.
If a specified entry already contains a file, the file will first be removed
from the table and closed. It's consistent with the behavior of updating an
existing file with
.BR io_uring_register_files_update (3).
Note that old kernels don't check the SQE
.I file_index
field, which is not a problem for liburing helpers, but users of the raw
io_uring interface need to zero SQEs to avoid unexpected behavior. This also
means that applications should check for availability of
.B IORING_OP_ACCEPT_DIRECT
before using it, they cannot rely on a
.B -EINVAL
CQE
.I res
return.

This function prepares an async
.BR accept4 (2)
request. See that man page for details.

.SH RETURN VALUE
None
.SH ERRORS
The CQE
.I res
field will contain the result of the operation. While the non-direct accept
returns the installed file descriptor as its value, the direct accept
returns
.B 0
on success. The caller must know which direct descriptor was picked for this
request. See the related man page for details on possible values for the
non-direct accept. Note that where synchronous system calls will return
.B -1
on failure and set
.I errno
to the actual error value, io_uring never uses
.I errno.
Instead it returns the negated
.I errno
directly in the CQE
.I res
field.
.SH NOTES
As with any request that passes in data in a struct, that data must remain
valid until the request has been successfully submitted. It need not remain
valid until completion. Once a request has been submitted, the in-kernel
state is stable. Very early kernels (5.4 and earlier) required state to be
stable until the completion occurred. Applications can test for this
behavior by inspecting the
.B IORING_FEAT_SUBMIT_STABLE
flag passed back from
.BR io_uring_queue_init_params (3).

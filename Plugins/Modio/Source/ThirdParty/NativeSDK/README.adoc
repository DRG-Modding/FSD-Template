Welcome to the mod.io SDK repository, built using C++. It allows game developers to host and automatically install user-generated content in their games. It connects to the https://docs.mod.io[mod.io REST API].

== Features

* Permissive MIT/BSL-license
* Async callback-based interface
* Non-blocking IO with a 'bring your own thread' model
* Automatic downloads and updates
* Email / Steam / GoG authentication
* Mod Browsing / Filtering
* Header-only support with C++17 compiler or later
* C++14 codebases can use a static library or direct compilation
* Native Unreal Engine 4 integration available via our https://github.com/modio/modio-ue4[dedicated plugin]

== Download repository

Pre-requisites to compile this SDK are listed in link:doc/getting-started.adoc[Getting Started documentation]

It is possible to download the source code as a zip file from this webpage. However, a recursive clone downloads all dependencies. Therefore, the suggestion is to perform the following:

[source, zsh]
----
git clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/modio/modio-sdk
cd modio-sdk
----

== Installation

To use the mod.io SDK, you can proceed with the installation using one of the following perspectives:

- Inside a CMake project
- Standalone: <<header-only>>
- Standalone: <<separate-compilation>>
- Standalone: <<static-library>>

=== Inside a CMake project

. Clone the repository, or add it as a submodule
. Confirm `your_project` uses CMake 3.15 or later
+
[source,cmake]
----
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
----
. Specify the target platform
+
[source,cmake]
----
set (MODIO_PLATFORM WIN)
----
. Add the SDK subdirectory to your project
+
[source,cmake]
----
add_subdirectory(<modio-sdk folder> EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
----
. Link the library to your project
+
* To use the header-only configuration:
+
[source,cmake]
----
target_compile_features(your_project PUBLIC cxx_std_17)
target_link_libraries(your_project PUBLIC modio)
----
* Or to use the static library configuration:
+
[source,cmake]
----
target_compile_features(your_project PUBLIC cxx_std_14)
target_link_libraries(your_project PUBLIC modioStatic)
----


=== Standalone
To simplify the SDK compilation, the file `CMakePresets.json` includes the most common configurations as `presets` that employ Ninja by default. Therefore, confirm it is available on your `PATH` unless you want to <<override, override>> the CMake generator in use.

|===
|Platform | Preset       | Target       | Build System
|Windows  | win64        | Release      | Visual Studio 2019
|Windows  | win64-debug  | Debug        | Visual Studio 2019
|Windows  | win64-dbginfo| Pre-Release  | Visual Studio 2019
|===

Debug presets have the `-debug` suffix, and Release-with-debug-info is `-dbginfo`. If you want to build the SDK in debug configuration specify `win64-debug` as the preset name.

To build the SDK using the default build and install directories:

. `cmake -S <modio-sdk folder> --preset=win64`
+
This will use the Ninja generator to create a Ninja build system in `<modio-sdk folder>/out/build/win64`. It installs the compiled libraries/headers to `<modio-sdk folder>/out/install/win64`.
. `cmake --build <modio-sdk folder>/out/build/win64`
+
This step compiles the SDK as a static library.
. `cmake --install <modio-sdk folder>/out/build/win64`
+
This produces a folder `<modio-sdk folder>/out/install/win64` with the following:
+
* `header_only` - directory with the header-only version of the SDK
* `source` - directory containing the implementation files of the SDK for use in 'split compilation' mode
* `static` - directory containing the static library binaries and necessary public include headers

==== Header-only mode [[header-only]]

Simply add each of the subdirectories in `header_only` to your include directories. Then, in `your_project` source file add `#include "modio/ModioSDK.h"`

==== Separate compilation mode [[separate-compilation]]

If you prefer to compile the source code directly, add the `cpp` files in the `source` directory, along with the `include` from the header-only mode.
You must add `MODIO_SEPARATE_COMPILATION` to your project's compiler definitions. Then, in `your_project` source file add `#include "modio/ModioSDK.h"`

==== Static library mode [[static-library]]

Add the `inc` directory inside `static` to your `include` and link against the static binary in the `lib` folder.  You must add `MODIO_SEPARATE_COMPILATION` to your project's compiler definitions. Then, in `your_project` source file add `#include "modio/ModioSDK.h"`

=== Other Build Systems [[override]]

If you use a different build system or wish to generate project files for inclusion in an existing Visual Studio solution, you can override the default CMake generator. For example, it is possible to use an MSBuild-based Visual Studio Solution:

```
cmake -S <modio-sdk folder> --preset=win64 -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"
cmake --build <modio-sdk folder>/out/install/win64
cmake --install <modio-sdk folder>/out/install/win64
```

== Game studios and Publishers [[contact-us]]
A private, white-label option is available for license. If you want a fully-featured platform that you control and host in-house send us a message mailto:developers@mod.io[Contact us,Whitelabel Inquiry] to discuss.

== Contributions Welcome
Our SDK is public and open source. Game developers are welcome to utilize it directly, to add support for mods in their games, or fork it for their customized use. If you want to contribute to the SDK, submit a pull request with your recommended changes for review.

== Other Repositories

# FSD-Template

Project generated by Archengius' [UE4 Template Generator](https://github.com/Archengius/UE4GameProjectGenerator). Reflected C++ classes generated by CheatingMuppet & Archengius' [UE4SS UHT Generator](https://github.com/UE4SS/UE4SS). If you want to use these tools to generate an FSD project yourself, contact me (Buckminsterfullerene#6666) on Discord for information on how to fix all of the build errors *of which there are plenty*.

To use, click use this as a template, clone or fork the repository and follow these steps:
* Right click FSD.uproject and open with Rider or Visual Studio. 
* You should then be able to build and run Unreal Engine from there - **NOTE** that it will take a while on the first time since it has to build all the modules. 
* Then you can copy all of your files from your old FSD projects to the Content folder. 
* When you go to package your project for the first time, it will rebuild all the modules again, so it will take another while. From then on it should all be normal speed.

If your project building is getting errors along the lines of:
> c1xx: fatal error C1076: compiler limit: internal heap limit reached<br>
> c1xx: error C3859: Failed to create virtual memory for PCH


Then you need to just build it again. Same with first time packaging - package it again.

Enjoy!
